Finalmente, Roma!

I arrived in Rome. A statement so ordinary that it does not merit a consideration, until I reveal to you that as a 48-year-old, western-trained artist, this was the first time I set foot in Italy. What should have been every artist's destination has become to me a sort of a bucket list. 

Many plans had been made for Egypt, Turkey, Greece, and Italy, since 1992\. But many a times plans have been thwarted for one reason or another: Natural phenomenon (like rain and flooding in the region); family matters (illness in the family); to work schedule (last minute cancellations). 

I felt like the curse had been broken. With my first step into Italia, albeit a brief 6-day visit, I hope more visits to the Eternal City and beyond will happen.
